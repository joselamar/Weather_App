# Weather App

## Objectives:
  
  1. Create a weather android application with 2 screens (*i.e.* one for current weather, and other for 10 european cities)  
  2. Consume an API (*e.g.* http://openweathermap.org/api)

## Noticeable Features
	* Clean and Responsive UI
	* MVVM implementation
	* Splash Screen
	* Checking internet connection
	* Checking and asking for location permission and suggestion to activate it
	* If location permission is denied "Dummy location" is loaded
	* Loading Screen when making API calls
	* API calls every 5 minutes
	* Settings to define metric or imperial units

## Inspiration
* Native Weather App for iOS
* iOS weather app - https://www.behance.net/gallery/iOS7-Weather-App/9650557

## Input
	* First time using Kotlin to develop an android application
	* Effort to follow the MVVM standards
	* Despite the use of a flexible layout, due to time constraints, there is only one layout resource so the app might malfunction on other screensizes
	* Deployed and Tested on Pixel 3a XL API 28
	* Possible Future Work
	  * Use Depedency Injectors
	* I really enjoyed the challenge
	* Hours consumed : 45h
