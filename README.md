# Weather App

## Objectives:
  
  1. Create a weather android application with 2 screens (*i.e.* one for weather at user location, and other for 10 european cities) 
  2. Use MVVM Architecture
  3. Use Jetpack Components
  4. Consume an API (*e.g.* http://openweathermap.org/api)

## Noticeable Features
	* MVVM implementation as seen in Android Kotlin Fundamentals by Google Codelabs
	* Clean and Responsive UI
	* Coroutines to perform background network requests
	* Handling offline caching - Loads data from Room database always
	* Data Binding
	* Checking and asking for location permission and suggestion to activate it
	* If location permission is denied "Dummy location" is loaded
	* Settings to define metric or imperial units
